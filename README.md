# 28p

*28p* is a simplistic, lightweight and responsible Wordpress theme for a
personal blog. It was formerly known as *pistole* but after publishing it
on github, I decided to change the name to **28p**.

## Important

**This theme is under development. It is (not yet) ready to be put out in public
for everyone to use.** However, if you know what you are doing, you are free to
clone this repository and create your own. I am currently transfering the whole
development from my personal *svn* over to github.

## License

The theme is available under a [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).

## Used software, credits and thanks

This theme would not exist if not for the wonderful web developers out there who
share their thoughts, work and inspiration. Special thanks go out to the Wordpress
team, the guys of jQuery and the html5boilerplate. And [Aral Balkan](http://twitter.com/aral)
who inspired me to do all this.
