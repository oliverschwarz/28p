# 28p

*28p* is a simplistic, lightweight and responsible Wordpress theme for a
personal blog. It was formerly known as *pistole* but after publishing it
on github, I decided to change the name to **28p**.

**This theme is under development. It is (not yet) ready to be put out in public
for everyone to use.** However, if you know what you are doing, you are free to
clone this repository and create your own. I am currently transfering the whole
development from my personal *svn* over to github.
